NAME
    SPOPSx::Tool::HashField - A SPOPS extension for the storage of complex
    objects

SYNOPSIS
      %conf = (
          table_alias => {
              # ...
              yaml_fields => [ qw/ arguments locals results / ],
              # ...
          }
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This allows for the storage of Perl aggregate types in a database field.
    This uses YAML to perform the marshalling and unmarshalling. This is
    handy because you can use third-party tools to update the stored data
    with relative ease and the data is readable even in other languages that
    have a YAML model. The data structure can be arbritraily deep.

INSTALLATION
    Just the typical install tricks will do:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    or:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    Take your pick.
